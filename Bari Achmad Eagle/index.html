            <p>The eagle is a large bird of prey belonging to the family Accipitridae. Known for their powerful build, sharp vision, and majestic flight, eagles are often regarded as symbols of strength, freedom, and keen sight. Here's a detailed overview:</p>
            
            <h2 id="physical-characteristics">1. Physical Characteristics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Size: Eagles are large birds, with some species like the Harpy Eagle having wingspans exceeding 7 feet (2.1 meters).</li>
                <li>Beak: Eagles have a strong, hooked beak that is perfect for tearing flesh from their prey.</li>
                <li>Talons: They possess powerful, curved talons for gripping and killing prey.</li>
                <li>Eyesight: Eagles have incredibly sharp vision, estimated to be 4 to 8 times stronger than that of humans, allowing them to spot prey from great distances.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="habitat">2. Habitat</h2>
            <p>Eagles are found worldwide, except in Antarctica. They tend to prefer open or semi-open areas and are often seen near large bodies of water, where they hunt fish, or in forests where they prey on small mammals and birds.</p>
            
            <h2 id="diet">3. Diet</h2>
            <p>Eagles are carnivorous and are considered apex predators in their habitats. Their diet includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fish: Species like the Bald Eagle primarily hunt fish.</li>
                <li>Mammals: Many eagles hunt small to medium-sized mammals such as rabbits and rodents.</li>
                <li>Birds: Some eagles, like the Crowned Eagle, hunt other birds.</li>
                <li>Carrion: While they prefer fresh kills, eagles will also eat carrion if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="behavior">4. Behavior</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hunting: Eagles are solitary hunters, relying on their powerful flight and keen eyesight to locate and capture prey.</li>
                <li>Nesting: Eagles build large nests, called eyries, usually high in trees or on cliffs. These nests are used year after year, with new material added each season.</li>
                <li>Mating: Eagles are generally monogamous and may mate for life. The pair will often work together to raise their young.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="types">5. Types of Eagles</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bald Eagle: Native to North America, it's the national bird of the United States and is known for its white head and tail with a dark brown body.</li>
                <li>Golden Eagle: Found across the Northern Hemisphere, it's one of the best-known birds of prey in the world.</li>
                <li>Harpy Eagle: Found in Central and South America, it's one of the largest and most powerful eagles, with a wingspan of up to 7 feet.</li>
                <li>Crowned Eagle: Native to sub-Saharan Africa, it's known for hunting monkeys and other large prey.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="symbolism">6. Symbolism and Cultural Significance</h2>
            <p>Eagles have been revered in various cultures throughout history. They symbolize power, freedom, and transcendence and are often used as emblems by nations and military organizations.</p>
            
            <h2 id="conservation">7. Conservation Status</h2>
            <p>While some eagle species are thriving, others are endangered due to habitat loss, pollution, and hunting. Conservation efforts are in place in many parts of the world to protect these majestic birds. Eagles are not only magnificent creatures of the wild but also important indicators of the health of the ecosystems they inhabit.</p>
